The process of tackling this problem consists of several substeps:
1. Problem domain investigation for:
   - existing solutions (could serve a purpose of a baseline model for further work and performance comparison);
   - latest research in the area (possible guidlines for optimal solutions space elimination) [1];

2. Data analysis:
   -

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - training / validation splits generation
   - data transformation:
   - development of efficient data pipelines for training 
   - 

4. Model
   - architecture
   - loss
   - metrics

5. Training
   - baseline
   - pretraining
   - fine-tuning
     
6. Inference
   
8. Error Analysis
